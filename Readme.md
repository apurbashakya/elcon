ELCON- Smart Energy Conservation


We aim to use predictive analytics to output expected electricity usage and with the help of smart home integration, the resources using maximum amount of energy, which indeed is saving a lot of electricity and power consumption.

Description
Weâ€™ll develop a real-time automatic notification alert web based system for saving electricity.Along with a daily, monthly and yearly analysis of data about electricity usage. We aim to use predictive analytics to output expected electricity usage and with the help of smart home integration, the resources using maximum amount of energy. This system can also interpret whether the house is empty with the number of mobile devices connected to the home wifi and accordingly minimize the use of non essential appliances.The adaption is supported by enabling regional languages over standardized english to increase adoption and using pictorial representation for easier understanding of collected data. The flagship feature enables electricity cost estimation for the current cycle and minimizing phantom electricity use, saving costs by around 6 %.
